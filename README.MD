## Releasing a new version

Make sure you have the WiDoCo 1.4.x jar downloaded in the root of this repo, and you have JAVA and Node.js installed.
Then, execute

```shell
npm install
cd ./dist
node build.js
```

The folders in `dist` should mimic the same structure and contents under https://w3id.org/function.

## Validating

Different tools exist to validate against SHACL Shapes. </br>
⚠️The current issue is that these tools yield **different** result,
which can be observed when inspecting the outputs generated by the following validators.

### Validator: `github:TopQuadrant/shacl-js`

Execute
```bash
npm i
npm run test
```

### Validator: Jena's `shacl`

```
❯ shacl --version
Jena:       VERSION: 4.4.0
Jena:       BUILD_DATE: 2022-01-30T15:09:41Z
```

Execute
```bash
./test/test.sh
```

### Validator: `pyshacl`

Install
```bash
pip install rdflib pyshac
```

Execute
```bash
python test/test.py
```
